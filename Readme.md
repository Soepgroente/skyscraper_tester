Make the tester executable by running "make" in terminal.

Execute with "./rush01checker" or "./rush01checker bonus" if the team has done the bonus. The executable MUST be named "rush-01". The tester will stop if a valid testcase is incorrect to display the error.

All valid 4x4s are tested, a select few 5x5-9x9s are tested, feel free to add testcases to the .txt files.

The "testexecutable" folder has my own solver you can test with if you don't have a rush executable, simply copy paste it into the main folder.
